                        The intent of this Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator is preservation; the ability to play games is considered a "side-effect." MAME supports thousands of classic arcade games. As of version 0.162 MAME absorbed its sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System) which means it is also capable of playing games for classic game consoles. <br />

                        The project has been running for almost 20 years for any PlayStation 2 game fanatic.

            <h2>What is an Emulator?</h2>

            <p>
                In computing, an emulator is hardware or software or both that duplicates (or emulates) the functions of one computer system (the guest) in another computer system (the host),different from the first one, so that the emulated behavior closely resembles the behavior of the real system (the guest).

                <br /><br /> This focus on exact reproduction of behavior is in contrast to some other forms of computer simulation,in which an abstract model of a system is being simulated. For example,a computer simulation of a hurricane or a chemical reaction is not emulation.

                            <h3>Microsoft Windows</h3><br />
                            You simply have to download the latest binary archive available from <a href="http://www.mamedev.org">mamedev.org</a> and to extract its content to a folder. You will end up with many files (below you will find explanations about some of these), and in particular mame.exe. This is a command line program. The installation procedure ends here. Easy, isnâ€™t it?
                            <h3>Other Operating Systems</h3><br />
                            In this case, you can either look for pre-compiled (SDL)MAME binaries (e.g. in the repositories of your favorite Linux distro) which should simply extract all the needed files in a folder you choose, or compile the source code by yourself. In the latter case, see our section on compiling MAME.
